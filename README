Womz Storage Manager WSM
Author: Eric Wamsley
Site: http://ewams.net

Summary
WSM aims to provide a simple utility for managing storage devices on a Linux system.

Details
WSM is a Perl program that uses common built-in features of an OS to manage the many aspects of storage devices on a Linux system.

Features
Scan for new storage devices
View storage devices and device details
View, create, and delete logical partitions
Format a partition with a filesystem
Install S.M.A.R.T tools (smartmontools) and RAID tools (mdadm) if desired

TODO
Manage RAID devices
Manage file systems (todo: mounting)
etc.

Notes:
Only currently tested on Debian 6

For filesystem format functionality the mkfs program has to have the associated filesystem utilited installed, (IE, for btfs: btrfs-tools, for xfs: xfsprogs, for jfs: jfsutils, for resier4: reiser4progs).


Filesystems tested:
bfs
btrfs
ext2
ext3
ext4
jfs
minix
reiser4
xfs
