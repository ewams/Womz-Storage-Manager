Womz Storage Manager WSM
Author: Eric Wamsley
Site: http://ewams.net

Summary
WSM aims to provide a simple utility for managing storage devices on a Linux system.

How to run
1) Download wsm.pl to the target system
2) chmod +x wsm.pl
3) ./wsm.pl
4) Follow instructions and provide input with keyboard

Details
WSM is a Perl program that uses common built-in features of an OS to manage the many aspects of storage devices on a Linux system to simplify administration overhead.

Features
Scan for new storage devices
View storage devices and device details
View, create, and delete logical partitions
Format a partition with a filesystem
Mount and unmount a filesystem
Add a filesystem mount to be persistent on reboots
Install S.M.A.R.T tools (smartmontools), RAID tools (mdadm), and partition tools (GNU parted)

TODO
RAID devices
Help / videos

Notes:
Application must be ran as root.

Only currently tested on Debian 6.

For filesystem format functionality the mkfs program has to have the associated filesystem utility installed, (IE, for btfs: btrfs-tools, for xfs: xfsprogs, for jfs: jfsutils, for resier4: reiser4progs).

To mount a filesystem the kernel must know how to use the filesystem.

Filesystems tested
btrfs
ext2
ext3
ext4
jfs
reiser4
xfs


Known Issues
Unable to mount a partition if it does not have a UUID
